  An Ode to Meal Prep
</b>
</h3>
<p>
  On your way to work, a commute that stays the same<br>
  thinking of your tasks, and how you'll start the day<br>
  I'll write some code, take breaks to play a game,<br>
  But what will I have for lunch, you'll say?<br>

  It'll be tasty and healthy<br>
  It'll be assembled with love and precision<br>
  One thing it will definitely not be<br>
  is a point of indecision<br>

  Lunch will be a puzzle<br>
  cobbled together from different pieces<br>
  And at home you can give your pet a proper nuzzle<br>
  Cuz you've prepped, so dinner will be just as easy<br>

  All the pieces will be at your fingertips<br>
  Complex carbs, protein, fiber and vegetables<br>
  which will leave no room for a craving for chips<br>
  but with just enough flexibility to combine your comestibles as you wish<br>

  And your coworkers will ooh and aah<br>
  and your loved ones will love you more<br>
  and asked how you managed to put together such a plate<br>
  without it being a chore<br>
  and you'll quickly reply<br>
  you too can meal prep! just use this app, and you'll have healthy delicious food on the fly!<br>
